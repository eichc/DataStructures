Lecture 3: Classes Part 1
- encapsulaiton = grouping data and functions together
- data abstraction = giving user access to interface, but not implementation
- classes let you define a new type of object
- see date.h for example class header (declares the class)
	- see date.cpp for initialization of the class
	- see date_main.cpp for implementation of the class
- class header
	- must end with semicolon after closing bracket
	- separate blocks of declarations, as either public or private
		- private variables
		- public functions, including accessors and modifiers
