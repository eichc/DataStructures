DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:

My statistic calculates how frequently each type of penalty occurs. To do this, I needed
to keep track of every penalty that occured across each game in the input file. The most
challenging part was figuring out how to track the number of times each penalty had occured,
since the penalty names and counts couldn't be stored in the same vector. I got around this
by adding every penalty into a single vector, sorting it, then using that to create two
separate vectors: one for the penalty names, and one for the counts.
