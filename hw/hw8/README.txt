TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 

In order to test my code, I used a combination of the gdb debugger, Valgrind, and cout statements in order to
find if there were bugs. When the code wasn't working as intended and the issue wasn't a memory or syntax
error, I sprinkled cout statements throughout the functions being used at the time in order to pinpoint which
part of the code caused the bug. Once my code was working for the provided test file, I tested corner cases
such as empty trees in a small, separate test file.
