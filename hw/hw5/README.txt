DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SHIPFREIGHT ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimal (fastest train speed, most freight, fewest number
of engines used, and fewest resulting trains) for any input.  Note:
Student choice on how to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your
priorization and your implementation.

Although my shipfreight algorithm isn't 100% optimized, I did implement an option to use either 1
or 2 engines. Most of the time 2 engines are used in each train to reduce the overall number of
trains created, but if the train is going to be short then only one engine is used, so as to not
waste a second engine.



DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SEPARATE ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimally comfortable trains (smaller values for average
distance to dining and/or larger values for closest engine to sleeper)
and/or optimally handling cases with > 2 engines.  Student choice on how 
to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your priorization and your
implementation.
